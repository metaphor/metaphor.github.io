    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Pain Point</h3>

<p>As a software developer going to give presentations, the frequent
requirement is to present code, retaining the <em>syntax highlight</em>. Your
editor has already highlighted your code, but if you copy &amp; paste the
code directly into to presentation (PowerPoint or Keynote), the code
might be left default color.</p>

<p>This post is going to show you a way satisfy yourself.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>The <strong>Silver Bullet</strong> underneath is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format">RTF</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft PowerPoint &amp; Mac OS Keynote both support displaying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format">RTF</a> text.</p>

<p>By default, your <strong>copy is plain text</strong> and has nothing to do with
format, therefore PowerPoint or Keynote render it as plain text as well.</p>

<p>That means if your editors could <strong>copy your code as RTF</strong>, then <strong>paste</strong>
the result into presentation, it will display syntax highlighted. The
question left to us is how to <strong>copy code as RTF</strong> in your code editors.
This is is just a simple conversion, from your editor syntax highlight
style to RTF.</p>

<h3>Reference Implementation</h3>

<p><strong><em>Easy Enough!</em></strong></p>

<p>Some guy might find that, Eclipse can easily do this(try it!), that&rsquo;s
because it builds in the functionality, while other editors might not
be so obvious, such as IntelliJ. But the support could be done by
certain plugin.</p>

<p>For this post, I prefer <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>, since it is easy to setup and
it supports a lot of languages syntax highlights. (you could copy the
code to <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> first from other editors) Download &amp; Install <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Install Package Manager</li>
</ul>


<p>To install package, you need the package manager for convienence,
please following <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation">http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/n1k0/SublimeHighlight">SublimeHighlight</a></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/n1k0/SublimeHighlight">SublimeHighlight</a> is the right plugin to enable <strong>copy as RTF</strong>.</p>

<p>For how to install package, please following</p>

<pre><code>1. Command + Shift + P to popup the control panel (on Windows it might be Ctrl + Shift + P)
2. choose "Install Package"
3. choose "SublimeHighlight" in the package list
</code></pre>

<p>For plugin configuration detail following <a href="https://github.com/n1k0/SublimeHighlight">https://github.com/n1k0/SublimeHighlight</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Copy as RTF</li>
</ul>


<p>First you need to set the right syntax highlight to your code, and
then select the region you are copying, on right context menu &ldquo;Copy as
RTF&rdquo;, paste the code to your Keynote or PowerPoint(you might need
select <em>keep formatting</em> on PowerPoint).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! Hope you enjoy your presentations.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A network adatper is the way for your virtual machine instances to connect
outside world, rather working as a standalone node.</p>

<h3>VirtualBox has 4 types of network adapters</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> has basically 4 types of network adapters, provding
comprehensive means to build your network topology.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4>NAT (Network Address Transform)</h4>

<p>With this adpater, the virtual instance can access the outside world by
forwarding the request to host, and the host might re-farword the
response back to the virtual instance. The forwarding rules could be
configured.</p>

<p>The disadvantage is that the outside world knows only the host, rather the
viratual instance. This means you cannot access the instance directly.</p>

<h4>Bridged</h4>

<p>Bridged adapter might be the easiest and most user friendly. It makes
the virtual instance a new physical node like in your network environment, separating
from the host. It could obtain IP address from DHCP server.</p>

<p>Such ease leads to an inconvience, your instance network configuration
changes as long as your host network environment changes. That means
each time you need a different IP to connect to the instance.</p>

<h4>Internal Network</h4>

<p>This adapter usually uses static IP and only allows virtual instance to communicate with other
instances generated by the same VirtualBox. This result in that even
the host cannot access the instance. Of course, the instance has no
Internet access.</p>

<h4>Host Only</h4>

<p>This is my favorite adpater, it combines advantages both of Bridged
and Internal Network. Virtual instances and host can commnunicate with
each other without any problem. But the instance cannot connect
the Internet, because it does not connect to the network environment
of the host.</p>

<p>To configure Host only adapter, you need to set up a host only
network first. On Mac OS, goes to <code>Preferences &ndash;> Network &ndash;> Add(Host
only network)</code></p>

<h3>How to choose right adapters</h3>

<p>Each adapter has its own limitations, so the best solution is to configure
those adapters in a combined way. VirtualBox allows you to configure multiple adpaters
within same instances. Also different use cases have their own
combinations.</p>

<h4>Instances within same host</h4>

<p>Sometimes your instances would be created only in the same host, eg,
experimental cluster on you laptop. In this case, I would like to combine,</p>

<ul>
<li>NAT</li>
<li>Host-only</li>
</ul>


<p>This combination allows the virtual instances to access Internet. The
host and virtual instances can consistently communicate with each other over static
IP.</p>

<h4>Instances acrossing hosts</h4>

<p>In real world, there is no such experiment, if you want to leverage
the VirtualBox for your infrastructure, you probly need to start new
instances across different hosts. In this case, it requires the
commnunication between instances across hosts. The host only adapter might not
fit in this case, so I would like to use,</p>

<ul>
<li>Bridged</li>
<li>Switch infrastructure</li>
</ul>


<p>Bridged instance connect to your network infrastructure via switch, working as
new physical machine. Basically, this allow virtual instances to access the Internet as
well if your network infrastructure allows.</p>
